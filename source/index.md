The Convenience Store contains fairly opinionated scripts and commands in copy-paste form to be referenced when setting up newly installed Linux-based distributions or even macOS too.

```{warning}
    Make sure you understand what you are doing when attempting to run these scripts and commands.
    Always inspect EVERY script BEFORE EXECUTION.
