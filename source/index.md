# Anh's Unix Documentation \(AUD\)

Homepage: <https://hoanganh.tech>

Git repo: <https://github.com/aaanh/linux-docs>

AUD is my opinionated copy-paste scripts and commands for referencing when I set up my work environment in Linux-based distros and Unix-based OS (over and over again).

This docs is hosted on a Debian Linux VM.
