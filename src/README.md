# The Convenience Store

Ever get tired of constantly Googling every time you have to install or set up something? I do.

Linux packages or Windows programs or script-based installations, remember what to do is a pain in the ass and an overall crappy DX, as you are constantly ripped out of your flow to get the tools necessary to work. And let's say you have just bought a brand spanking new computer or setting up a new VM, the momentous urge of diving right into creating _things_ as fast as possible is fleeting every second you spend gathering the dev requirements and dependencies.

That is why I started this convenience store. To add some nitrous (NO2/NOS) to \[y\]our DX.

> Originally, I created the convenience store with Sphinx docs mostly for \*nix-based environments. But I have come to term that I would have to work on whatever the business needs dictate so I expand to win32 as well. Because my vision no longer aligns with the original intent, I have scrapped the old site and now we have this.

# Contributing

The documentation is not only for me, it's also for the community! If you know or believe there is a better way to do things, like a faster and more secure script, fork the repository <https://github.com/aaanh/convenience-store>, make changes, and open a [pull request](https://github.com/aaanh/convenience-store/pulls). I will try my best to review it asap.
